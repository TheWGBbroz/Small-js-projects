	<h3>'Rocket' evolution</h3>
	<p>
		The ellipses are the rockets. The green ellipse is the rocket which has the average genes, which I thought was interesting to add.<br>
		The average rocket can't reproduce.<br>
		The obstacles (the pink ellipses) are placed randomly and if a rocket collides with it (or the boundaries) it gets stuck.<br>
		A rockets fitness value is 1 devided by the distance from the rocket to the target point (red ellipse).<br>
		If a rocket gets stuck it's fitness value is multiplied by 0.2.<br>
		Rockets with high fitness values have a low chance of dying, and the rockets with low fitness values have a high chance of dying.<br>
		After 10 seconds the rockets which are alive get to reproduce, with a mutation value applied.<br>
